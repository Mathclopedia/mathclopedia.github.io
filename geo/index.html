              <p> Geometry is about working backwards in order to solve problems. 
                Often you're given the answer to a problem and asked to demonstrate how 
                it’s true. To do this, you must utilize geometric proofs. </p>
              <p> This is shown with two-column proofs, take a look at the image below. </p>
