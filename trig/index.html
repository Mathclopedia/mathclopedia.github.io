          <h1>Here are some tips + tricks to tackle the unit circle </h1>
          <p> First of all, do NOT memorize this, it is very unnecessary </p>
          <p> Secondly, read this if you know what sin, cos, tan, reference angles and right triangles are. If you don't, read the info above and come back later. </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Find the reference angle </li>
            <li> Find the sin, cos, or tan of the reference angle. You do this by remembering the side lengths of the 30, 60, 90 or 45, 45, 90 triangles </li>
            <li> Check which quadrant the angle is in </li>
            <li> If you are finding sin, think about if y is negative or positive in that quadrant. If you are finding cos, think about if x is negative or positive quadrant. <br> If you are finding tan, find the negative/positive value of both x and y then divide sinx/cosx</li>
            <li> Switch the sign of the answer accordingly </li>
            <li> This takes some time, but don't get frustrated!</li>
          </ol>

          <h3> Let's Try this Together! </h3>
          <ol>
            <li> Let's find sin 7π/6 (210°) </li>
            <li> Find the reference angle. In this case, it is π/6</li>
            <li> What is sin of π/6? If you remember the 30, 60, 90 triangle, it is 1/2 </li>
            <li> Which quadrant is 7π/6 on the coordinate plane? It's in quadrant 3 where, where x and y are negative </li>
            <li> What does sin represent? Since we used the opposite angle (the y), sin represents the y value on a coordinate plane. </li>
            <li> Since y is negative in quadrant 3, we change 1/2 to -1/2 </li>
          </ol>

          <h3> Why the angles 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 are Different From the Right Triangle Values </h3>
          <p> For the x and y axis angles, think conceptually about the values </p>
          <p> Keep in mind that the radius of the circle is 1 </p>
          <ol>
            <li> When the angle is 0, the values is (1, 0) because it's the distance from the midpoint to the corners of the circle at 0°</li>
            <li> This principle is the same for the rest of the angles: When the angle is π/2 (90°), the value is (0,1) (cos π/2 = 0, sin π/2 = 1) </li>
            <li> When the angle is π (180°), the value is (-1,0) (cos π = 1, sin π = 0)</li>
            <li> When the angle is 3π/2 (270°), the value is (0,-1) (cos 3π/2 = 0, sin 3π/2 = -1)</li>
