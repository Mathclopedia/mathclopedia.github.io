       <h1>Trigonometry</h1>
       <p> We know that trigonometry sounds scary with all the big, fancy words. Don't worry :D. It's not as scary as it seems.</p>

      <h3> Right Triangles </h3>
      <!-- insert image of a right triangle on a coordinate plane -->
      <p> This is where sin, cos, and tan come in! yay! </p>
      <ul>
        <li> This principle is based on the coordinate plane </li>
        <li> Opposite: the side that is across from the angle </li>
        <li> Adjacent: the side that is below the angle </li>
        <li> Hypotenuse: the slanted side </li>
        <li> Each angle's corresponding side is across from it (ex. 30°'s corresponding side is 1)</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em"> A smaller side will have a corresponding smaller angle. A larger side will have a corresponding larger angle </li>
      </ul> 

      <h3> The Common Triangles You Will See</h3>
      <!-- insert image of 30, 60, 90 and 45, 45, 90 -->
      <ul>
        <li> This is the basis of the unit circle, which we will get into later of course. </li>
        <li> Most trigonometry problems involve knowing this triangle and the unit circle values </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Leave this space for tips; use the lower part for trigonometry -->
      <h3> Soh Cah Toa </h3>
      <!-- Draw a soh cah toa -->
      <ul>
        <li> S: sin (sine) </li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em"> oh: stands for opposite/hypotenuse </li>
        <li> C: cos (cosine) </li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em"> ah: stands for adjacent/hypotenuse </li>
        <li> T: tan (tangent)</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em"> oa: stands for opposite/adjacent </li>
        <li> This is how you solve for the sin, cos, or tan of a triangle </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> How to solve for sin, cos, tan </h3>
      <!-- insert example -->
      <ol>
        <li> Tilt the triangle so that the desired angle is on the bottom </li>
        <li> Look above at the Soh Cah Toa cheat sheet. Use the given values of each side to find the sin/cos/tan </li>
      </ol>

       <h3> How to Determine if sin/cos/tan is Negative or Positive </h3>
       <!-- add later -->
       <h4> A few notes </h4>
          <ul>
            <li> sin = y </li>
            <li> cos = x </li>
            <li> tan = sin/cos </li>
          </ul>
        <img src="../assets/unitcircle.png" alt="A picture of the unit circle.">
       <ol>
        <li> Solve for the sin/cos/tan value </li>
        <li> Check the value of the angle and think about which quadrant it would be on a coordinate plane </li>
        <li> Is the x value negative or positive (for cos)? Is the y value negative or positive (for sin)? </li>
        <li> Apply the negative/positive value to your answer </li>
        <li> For tan, find out if the values for sin and cos are positive/negative. Divide sin/cos</li>
       </ol>

       <h3> Reference angles </h3>
       <!-- Insert picture of the reference angles -->
       <ul>
        <li> The angle between the given angle and the closest x axis </li>
        <li> This is VERY important for the unit circle, which is why it's directly above it </li>
        <li> If you know the reference angle to any angle, finding the coordinates on a unit circle will be easy </li>
       </ul>

       <h1> Unit Circle!!! </h1>
       <div id = "unitCircle">
          <img src="../assets/unitcircle.png" alt="A picture of the unit circle.">
          <h1>Here are some tips + tricks to tackle the unit circle </h1>
          <p> First of all, do NOT memorize this, it is very unnecessary </p>
          <p> Secondly, read this if you know what sin, cos, tan, reference angles and right triangles are. If you don't, read the info above and come back later. </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Find the reference angle </li>
            <li> Find the sin, cos, or tan of the reference angle depending on what the question asks for </li>
            <li> Check which quadrant the angle is in </li>
            <li> If you are finding sin, think about if y is negative or positive in that quadrant. If you are finding cos, think about if x is negative or positive quadrant. <br> If you are finding tan, find the negative/positive value of both x and y then divide sinx/cosx</li>
            <li> Switch the sign of the answer accordingly </li>
            <li> This takes some time, but don't get frustrated!</li>
          </ol>

          <h3> Why the angles 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 are Different From the Right Triangle Values </h3>
          <p> For the x and y axis angles, think conceptually about the values </p>
          <p> Keep in mind that the radius of the circle is 1 </p>
          <ol>
            <li> When the angle is 0, the values is (1, 0) because it's the distance from the midpoint to the corners of the circle at 0°</li>
            <li> This principle is the same for the rest of the angles: When the angle is π/2 (90°), the value is (0,1) (cos π/2 = 0, sin π/2 = 1) </li>
            <li> When the angle is π (180°), the value is (-1,0) (cos π = 1, sin π = 0)</li>
            <li> When the angle is 3π/2 (270°), the value is (0,-1) (cos 3π/2 = 0, sin 3π/2 = -1)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3> csc, sec, cot </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> These are just 1/sin, 1/cos, and 1/tan respectively </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Trig Identities </h3>
        <!-- Insert pdf of trig identities -->
        <img src = "../assets/trig/trigidentities.JPG">
        <ul>
          <li> Used when simplifying big trigonometric equations </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3> Inverse Trig Functions </h3>
        <!-- insert picture; include arc tan -->
        <ul>
          <li> IS NOT 1/trig function!! </li>
          <li> It is used to find the angle of a trig function using its value on a unit circle </li>
          <li> A calculator only computes quadrant 1 and 4 for inverse sin and tan functions. For cos, it computes only quadrant 1 and 2. </li>
          <li> If you are asked to find the inverse trig function in a quadrant out of the calculator's range, pretend the computed angle is a reference angle </li>
          <li> Then, add the angle plus/minus the x axis pertaining to the reference angle </li>
          <!-- add example cuz its confusing af -->
        </ul>

        <h3> Graphing sin, cos </h3>
        <!-- Put the formula -->
        <h4> A few notes: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> y = k: midline </li>
          <li> |a| = amplitude </li>
          <li> 2π/b = period </li>
          <li> Midline: the middle horizontal line of a sin/cos function </li>
          <li> Amplitude: the range a point on a function goes up and down from the midline </li>
          <li> Period: a sector of a trig function, usually about 5 points </li>
          <li> To find the range of values of a period, add the period + h </li>
          <li> Make sure that x has no coefficient. If it does, distribute the coefficient out. The coefficient becomes b </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Sin </h4>
        <!-- Insert graph of sin x -->
        <ul>
          <li> Is an odd function (not symmetrical) </li>
          <li> If a is positive, the function begins by going up. If a is negative, the function begins by going down</li>
          <li> The first point is on the midline, second point is |a| +/- k (depending on the value of a), third is on the midline, fourth point is |a| +/- k (depending on the value of a), last point is on the midline </li>
          <li> If b is negative, the negative can be taken outside of the function (odd function) </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Cos </h4>
        <!-- Insert graph of cos x-->
        <ul>
          <li> Is an even function (symmetrical) </li>
          <li> If a is positive, the function begins by going down. If a is negative, the function begins by going up </li>
          <li> the first point is |a| +/- k (depending on the value of a), second point is on the midline, third point is |a| +/- k (depending on the value of a), fourth point is on the midline, fifth point is |a| +/- k (depending on the value of a)</li>
          <li> If b is negative, the negative can be dropped out completely (even function)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Graphing tan and cot </h3>

        <h4> A few notes </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Graphing tan is a bit different from sin and cos. It also looks completely different</li>
          <li> Period: π/b</li>
          <li> point of influction: (h,k) </li>
          <li> |a| = amplitude </li>
          <li> Point of influction (p.o.i): the mipoint of a tan function </li>
          <li> h is NOT the first point on a tan function like sin and cos. It is the middle point </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Tan </h4>
        <!-- insert a graph -->
        <ul>
          <li> Is an odd function (non symmetrical) </li>
          <li> If b is negative, the negative can be taken outside of the function (odd function) </li>
          <li> The first and last points are asymptotes </li>
          <li> The 2nd and 4th point are determined by the amplitude and if the equation is negative or positive </li>
          <li> If a is negative, the 2nd point is higher and 4th point is lower. If a is positive, the 2nd point is lower and the 4th point is higher </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Cot </h4>
        <!-- insert a graph -->
        <ul>
          <li> It is the same as a tan function, but the points are graphed oppositely </li>
          <li> It looks like tan was mirrored across the y axis </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Graphing csc and sec </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> It's not as scary as you might think. It is just grpahing cos and sin like normal, but on each elevated point, draw a parabola </li>
          <li> The points on the midpoint are asymptotes of the parabolas </li>
          <li> The parabolas are the graphs. Draw the cos and sin graphs like normal and once you add the parabolas, erase the original graph. The original graph was just a tempalte to help graph csc/sec </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Law of Sines </h3>
        <!-- Insert image of the formula -->

        <h3> Law of cosines </h3>

        <h3> Heron's Formula </h3>
        <!-- INsert heron's formula-->
