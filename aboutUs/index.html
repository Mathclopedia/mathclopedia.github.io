    <h3> Our Mission </h3>
        <p> Let's be honest, sometimes, math concepts are explained in a convoluted way on the internet, our main source of information
            in the modern day. Our goal was to make a singular website hub that contained EVERY math formula needed throughout high school math
            in order to make studying more efficient, especially for finals. Every photo was drawn by us and based on our own notes
            we wrote when we were in these classes ourselves. We know what you are going through, and we hope that we can lessen
            the burden of having to memorize all these formulas and concepts.
        </p>

            To clarify, this website is not intended to teach students 100% of math concepts, but rather, 
            be a place to remember forgotten concepts and to quickly access a reference sheet. Please do not blindly use these
            formulas without knowing why; it is best to understand why the formulas exist. We tried our best to explain each one!
            We hope you will enjoy utilizing this website to pass your tests. We wish you luck!

    <h3> ~A Few Notes From Us~ </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Math is hard. You probably know that yourself. However, with a bit of practice, you can do it. We all can. Don't give up</li>
      <li> The phrase "believe in yourself" is not taken seriously enough. You have to believe that you yourself can do it or else you won't be able to </li>
      <li> Ask your teacher, friend, or even parents for help. Asking questions is the best way to learn. Everyone around you is willing to help! </li>
      <li> You can do this!  You are more capable than you think. This applies to all subjects as well. </li>
      <li> Sorry, we will stop distracting you from math. GOOD LUCK~!</li>

            Hi everyone! My name is Sophie Choi and I am a junior at Arcadia High School! I first started coding when I was about 12
            years old. I originally didn't like coding because I thought it was something that only "nerds" did, but I ended up loving 
            it within my first lesson. Ever since then, I have done numerous activities involving computer science, such as being a part
            of Girls Who Code and Arcadia High School's Coding Club!
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to participate in the Mathclopedia project Avanti and I had been wanting to make something that would not only benefit us, 
            but high schoolers around the world. I also wanted to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and using a professional platform
            like GitHub! It was a wild ride making this project, so I hope you all feel satisfied with our effort! ♡

            Hello smart and beautiful people! My name is Avanti Gupta and I am a senior at Arcadia High School! I was first introduced to coding in 3rd grade by 
            Code.org and became more serious about it in sophomore year. I used to find coding boring and was uninterested until I signed up
            for a summer immersion program by Girls Who Code in 2021. Ever since, I have enjoyed coding new projects on my free time, 
            took place in more GWC programs, and took AP Computer Science A + AP Computer Science Principles. I also plan to 
            major in Data Science! 
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to participate in this project with Sophie as we wanted to make something that would benefit us and other kids 
            around the world. I also was eager to improve my skills in basic coding and learn more in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            This has been extremely fun and tiring at the same time for me with college apps going on at the same time LOL but I've learnt a lot. 
            I hope you all enjoy our project! ♡
