        <h1> Algebra 2! </h1>
        <p> Algebra 2 may seem scary, but don't worry, we will help you succeed :). </p>
        <p> Many of the concepts in Algebra 1 are in Algebra 2 or in trigonometry. If you can't find something on this page, it is most likely on the <a href = "alg1.html">Algebra 1</a> page or the <a href = "trig.html">Trigonometry </a> page. </p>
        
        <h3> Properties </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Associative Property: rearranging parantheses will not alter the answer (ex. 3 + (5 + 2) = (3 + 5) + 2) </li>
          <li> Commutative Property:  changing the order of operands does not alter the answer (ex. 2 + 5 = 5 + 2)</li>
          <li> Distributive Property: a number next to parantheses will multiply with every number inside (ex. 3(7 + 2) = 21 + 6)</li>
          <li> Identity Property: the answer will be the same number that was added by 0 or multiplied by 1 (ex. 2 <span>&#183;</span> 1 = 2)</li>
          <li> Inverse Property: when a number is added with itself in its opposite sign, the answer is 0 (ex. 5 + (-5) = 0)</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Draw an inequality later-->
        <h3> Inequalities </h3>
        <h4> Open and Closed Holes/Circle </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> An open hole/circle represents greater/less than (> <)</li>
          <li> An closed hole/circle represents greater/less than or equal to (<span>&#8805;</span> <span>&#8804;</span>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> And </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> The value of x is in between two values. x has to satisfy BOTH inequalities </li>
          <li> Ex. -2 < x < 3 </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Or </h4>
        <ul>
           <li> The value of x is NOT in between two values. x has to satisfy EITHER inequality. </li>
           <li> Ex. x > 0 or x <span>&#8804;</span> -2. x can't be -1 since it is not greater than 0 or less than -2. </li>
        </ul>
