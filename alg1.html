        <h3> X Box Method for Factoring </h3>
        <!-- INsert image later im real lazy rn-->
        <ol>
          <li> Put "a <span>&#183;</span> c " at the top of the X and "b" at the bottom of the X </li>
          <li> Find two numbers that multiply to "a" AND add up to "b" </li>
          <li> One they are found, make two binomials like this: (ax<sup>2</sup> + 1st number)(2nd number + c)</li>
          <li> Take out a common factor for each binomial.</li>
          <li> If the binomial in the parantheses are the same, which they should be, put the factors into their own binomial in parantheses. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Vertical Motion </h3>
        <!-- Insert photo of vertical motion formula -->
        <ul>
          <li> S = initial height </li>
          <li> v = velocity </li>
          <li> t = time </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Graphing Quadratics </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Quadratic form: ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</li>
          <li> Standard form: f(x) = a(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k</li>
          <li> x intercept form: a(x-p)(x-a) </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li> Vertex in standard form: (h, k) (when k = y and h = x)</li>
          <li> Vertex in quadratic form: (-b/2a), f(-b/(2a))</li>
          <li> Vertex in x intercept form: V((p+q)/2, f((p+q)/2))</li>
        </ul>
