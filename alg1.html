      <ul>
        <li> |x| = -x, x; |x| <span>&#8805;</span> 0 </li>
        <li> To solve for the other answer, isolate the absolute value sign and make the other side negative </li>
        <li> Always check for extraneous solutions: solutions that do not satisfy the equation </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Rewriting Literal Equations and Formulas </h3>
      <ul>

        <li> Set the equation to one variable </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Consecutive Integers </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Consecutive Odd Integers: 3, 5, 7, 9 </li>
        <li> Consecutive Odd Integers: 2, 6, 8, 10 </li>

      <!-- Add image of the 3 consecutive even + odd integers pg 14-->

      <h3> Area and Perimeter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Perimeter: length of the outline of a shape to find the perimeter of a rectangle or any polycom. Add the lengths of each side [2(length + width)]</li>
        <li> The area is the amount of pace in a polygon (length <span>&#183;</span> width) </li>
        <li> If the sides have variables, don't worry. For perimeter, add all the sides like usual and set it equal to a given perimeter to find the variable. For area, multiply length times width and set it equal to the area to find the variable. </li>
      </ul>

        </ul>

           <li> The value of x is NOT in between two values. x has to satisfy EITHER inequality. </li>
           <li> Ex. x > 0 or x <span>&#8804;</span> -2. x can't be -1 since it is not greater than 0 or less than -2. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Solving Absolute Value Inequalities </h3>
        <!-- insert 2 examples of and and or -->
        <ol>
          <li> Solve the inequality for the variable </li>
          <li> Solve the inequality again, but this time flip the sign and make one side negative </li>
          <li> Find out if the inequality is an "and" or "or" compound inequality </li>
          <li> If a variable is less than the SMALLEST number and greater than the LARGEST number, it is an "or" compound inequality </li>
          <li> If a variable is less than the LARGEST number and greater than the SMALLEST number, it is an "and" compount inequality </li>
        </ol>

          <li> Represented by ordered pairs or mapping diagram </li>
          <li> Function: relation that pairs each input with exactly one output. An input having two outputs is not a function (does not pass the verticle line test)</li>
          <li> Vertical line test: tests if a graph is a function. Draw a vertical line directly through the graph. If it touches more than two points on a graph, it's not a function. </li>
          <li> Domain = input = x </li>
          <li> range = output = y</li>

        </ul>

        <h3> Horizonal and Vertical Lines </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> y = # is a horizontal line. y will have the same value no matter the x </li>

          <li> f = function </li>
          <li> f(x) represents the output of f corresponding to the input of x. Fancy way of saying that there is a y value for every x value.</li>
        </ul>

          <li> k = vertical shift. A negative k value means the graph shifts downwards. A positive k value means the graph shifts upwards </li>
          <li> a = stretch/shrink </li>
          <li> g(x) = f(ax): If a > 1 = shrink towards y axis. If 0 < a < 1 = stretch away from the y axis </li>
