        <h1> Algebra 2! </h1>
        <p> Algebra 2 may seem scary, but don't worry, we will help you succeed :). </p>
        <p> Many of the concepts in Algebra 1 are in Algebra 2 or in trigonometry. If you can't find something on this page, it is most likely on the <a href = "alg1.html">Algebra 1</a> page or the <a href = "trig.html">Trigonometry </a> page. </p>

        <h3> Properties </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Associative Property: rearranging parantheses will not alter the answer (ex. 3 + (5 + 2) = (3 + 5) + 2) </li>
          <li> Commutative Property:  changing the order of operands does not alter the answer (ex. 2 + 5 = 5 + 2)</li>
          <li> Distributive Property: a number next to parantheses will multiply with every number inside (ex. 3(7 + 2) = 21 + 6)</li>
          <li> Identity Property: the answer will be the same number that was added by 0 or multiplied by 1 (ex. 2 <span>&#183;</span> 1 = 2)</li>
          <li> Inverse Property: when a number is added with itself in its opposite sign, the answer is 0 (ex. 5 + (-5) = 0)</li>
